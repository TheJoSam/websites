            <div class="text-flex">
                <p>
                    We're the newest Member of the TheJoSam Family the Racing Division.<br>
                    Our Story started not too long ago with Mountainbike Racing Technology and continued with Radio Controlled Cars and Drones.
                    And as of 2024 also parts for Motorcycles and their caretaking.
                    The Goal in our Products is the maximum performance and rich features so everyone can enjoy Racing Technology without going backrupt.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our Company was build up by TheJoSam for branding Prototypes designed for Racing.
                    As of our first steps in Engineering the 3D-Printing technology was our best friend and starting point for some Mods.
                    Today you can get Custom Parts for RC, Biking and Motorcycles and you can even request development of some special part.

                    <h3>Mountainbikes</h3>
                    <p>
                        Our starting point and first Division we had.
                        It started with small but anoying things and expanded to whole Tools and part modification.
                        Mountainbikes still hold a big impact here at TheJoSam Racing and will surely expand soon enough.

                    <h3>RC</h3>
                    <p>
                        The biggest part of our engineering and still is!
                        The Journey started with small add-ons and evolved to the development of full RC Cars.
                        RC Cars and Drones are sadly an dying Division here at TheJoSam Racing but we will stay open for Request.

                    <h3>Motorcycles</h3>
                    <p>
                        Now the newest and most interesting part of all. Motorcycles.
                        The Journey of developing tools for mountainbikes and the videography behind TheJoSam
                        was the cause to further evolve with the evolving status here at TheJoSam Racing.

                    Surely you are here because you either saw the Bike on the Streets or you seen an Video from us cut or recorded.
                    And yes we are very proud of the Aprilia that is branded, as it was the starting ground for our 2024 Motorcycle Development.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our Journey brought us to Social Media as part of Advertisement and a bit of Show-Off.
                    It isn't only our own content, the future will surely see some not-TheJoSam videos and Images being edited from TheJoSam Racing.
                    With it you can see the Cool Tech we have developed with TheJoSam Development.
